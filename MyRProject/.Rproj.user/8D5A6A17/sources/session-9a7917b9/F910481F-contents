#Challenge
#yesterday, we made a scatterplot of these data according to BackpackWeight and BodyWeight.
#Re-create this plot, but find a way to show different colors according to conditions of the variable Sex
#(Female or Male)

#Challenge2
#Add a legend to identify the sexes by their representative color
